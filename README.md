# Project Name

The project for this week was to create a chatbot. Anton and I thought of creating a chatbot for a travel agency that allows the user to request a quote for a trip to a European destination and decide whether to travel in business class or economy, and choose the departure time either morning or evening. Once all the options are selected, the bot would ask for an email address to send a quote at a later time.

## The problem

The main issue this week was working in pairs. Unfortunately, we didn't coordinate well with the work, and most of the code was written by me. The project is incomplete and needs some corrections. Unfortunately, having no more news from my colleague, I created a separate file to be able to present it by the deadline. I personally encountered problems in creating functions and linking global variables with the rest of the code. I consulted the AI multiple times and watched YouTube videos for inspiration and to understand how to manage the behavior of the JavaScript file. I would like to dedicate a few days to the project to be able to present it in a complete manner.
